The new model was rapidly manufactured on the basis of previous processes.However, the plan to further enhance \"Situation Controllers\" was suddenly terminated by the Fontaine Research Institute. After all, if these little things were capable of driving ferocious underwater creatures away, then what were all the other underwater meka for? In reality, these \"Situation Controllers\" were of no real use against the underwater creatures that actually posed a threat to the other meka, and could only deal with common fishes and damage the ecosystem. As a result, researchers had to shut down some of them intentionally and restrict their offensive capabilities.",

        "description": "Compact assistance meka developed to increase the overall utilization rates of meka teams, providing aid for underwater projects. They were originally designed to remove junk, vegetation, and other underwater debris in order to prevent these from clogging up the vital parts of other clockwork meka, thereby minimizing failure rates. From another point of view, they are undoubtedly benefiting Fontaine's ecosystem greatly as underwater cleaners.Equipped with high-sensitivity sensors, the meka can efficiently \"nose out\" target items through smells as well as detect the optical characteristics of underwater junk. As a result, they can be attracted by certain types of bait and are occasionally caught by anglers, who refer to them as \"Water Maintenance Fish\" or \"Iron Fish.\"Compared to the mass-deployed \"Initial Configuration\" model, the \"Water Body Cleaner\" model is more mature and coated with erosion-resistant material. The researchers responsible for this project introduced periodic callback and maintenance instead of just leaving them on their own after release. They would send out homing signals through flashing of a certain frequency in order to retrieve the meka, which they would then release again following maintenance and examination. Over time, certain individuals began to use this flashing method as a type of \"bait\" to catch these meka, and it is now widely known among the angling community.",

Thus, the Graffiti Alliance began to explore raising this kind of fish in ordinary aqueous environments. To accomplish this, the previous Graffiti Alliance's leader's previous predecessor began to work with the Natlan Fishing Association, expending an enormous sum to import clockwork fish from Fontaine, using \"Maintenance Mek\" tech to build an ecological simulation mek with onboard data collection capabilities and conduct extensive observations and research. Alas, the results were most disappointing: the horn-like crystal structures on Unihornfish heads ceased to shine with flame-like light after the fish left their liquid phlogiston environment, and so, the plan ended in failure.Fortunately, due to the way their dorsal fin extends above the water while they swim, these mek Unihornfish look kind of like sharks from a distance. Thanks to this, the People of the Springs ended up buying an appropriate quantity of these \"Pseudoshark Unihornfish\" from the Graffiti Alliance and Natlan Fishing Association.

They look like an unripe fruit on a tree branch, hence the nickname \"True Fruit.\"However, there are very few bones in this fish. The meat is fatty and rich, but if it's not handled properly, or you remove its gallbladder too late, the fish's meat will be as sour as unripe fruit. Therefore, \"making this fish delicious\" has become the standard by which all chefs are measured.",
